# Filter-Based Estimation Algorithms

State estimation filters are all specializations and/or simplifications of the generic [Bayes Filter](../Applied_Statistics_for_Stochastic_Processes/Bayesian_Inference.md). They can be categorized according to the simplifying assumptions that they make about the processes they estimate:

## Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Dynamics

...

## Nonlinear Dynamics

...

## Absence of Dynamics

Bayesian estimation collapses to optimization algorithms like [Least Squares](../../Search_and_Optimization/Least-Squares_Optimization.md) in this case.
