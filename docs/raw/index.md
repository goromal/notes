# Andrew's Notes

I'm a bit of a meticulous note taker--in part because it helps me retain information that is meaningful to me, and also because it provides an avenue for fleshing out ideas. I like to keep my notes on a wiki-style website for ease-of-access on my computer and mobile devices. While the vast majority of these notes are password-protected, occasionally I polish some notes to make publicly available. Below are my publicly published notes and articles on technical and non-technical topics.
